Malscan is an intuitive and easy to use malware scanner for linux, extending ClamAV with additional scanning modes and malware signatures.
It is targeted at Linux webservers, but can be used on Linux mailservers and desktops too, if you're into that.

This is the official documentation library for malscan. It is fully open source and editable.
